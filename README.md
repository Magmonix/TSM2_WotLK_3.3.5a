# TSM2_WotLK_3.3.5a
TSM2.8 that I found on some addon website.
A lot of random little things were broken with it.
Off the top of my head I remember that I fixed the way Sniper works.
I also fixed the abilty to search for items.
That being said, there's still a lot of stuff that doesn't seem to work.
If people are really interested in those other features I could possibly take a look.
TBH, I would use this addon for Sniper alone as it's YUGE.
